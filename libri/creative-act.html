                                    <ul>
                                        <li>What are the different ways we engage in creative acts daily?</li>
                                        <li>How does awareness influence the creative process?</li>
                                        <li>Why is labeling counterproductive to the creative process?</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Creativity extends beyond the realm of traditional art, manifesting in everyday actions such as conversations, problem-solving, and even rearranging furniture.</strong> It is an inherent human act that involves bringing something new into existence. This act is not limited to grand gestures and can be found in the smallest of interactions.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cultivating awareness is crucial for the creative process. It involves shifting from being the "doer" to the "witness," passively observing the world around us without attempting to control or categorize it.</strong> The act of labeling, while seemingly innocuous, shifts our focus from experiencing to analyzing, hindering our ability to perceive the raw essence of our experiences.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>"Creativity doesn’t exclusively relate to making art. We all engage in this act on a daily basis."</li>
                                <li>"In most of our daily activities we choose the agenda and develop a strategy to achieve the goal at hand. Awareness moves differently. The program is happening around us. The world is the doer and we are the witness. We have little or no control over the content."</li>
                                <li>"As soon as you label an aspect of Source, you’re no longer noticing, you’re studying."</li>

                                        <li>How do we access inspiration in our everyday lives?</li>
                                        <li>What role does the subconscious play in the creative process?</li>
                                        <li>How can we reframe self-doubt to serve us?</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Inspiration, a key ingredient in the creative process, can be found in unexpected places, often revealing itself in subtle moments that evoke a sense of awe.</strong> It is not something that can be forced, but rather something we cultivate by approaching life with curiosity and an openness to new experiences.</p>
                            <p><strong>Our subconscious holds a reservoir of untapped creative potential.</strong> Tapping into this reservoir can be achieved through practices such as dream recall, meditation, and engaging in activities that allow the mind to wander freely.</p>
                            <p><strong>Self-doubt, an inevitable companion to the creative process, serves as a reminder of our humanity.</strong> Instead of viewing self-doubt as a hindrance, embrace it as an opportunity for growth and authenticity.</p>

                                <li>"Pay particular attention to the moments that take your breath away."</li>
                                <li>"There’s an abundant reservoir of high-quality information in our subconscious, and finding ways to access it can spark new material to draw from."</li>
                                <li>"Self-doubt lives in all of us. And while we may wish it gone, it is there to serve us. Flaws are human, and the attraction of art is the humanity held in it."</li>

                                        <li>What is the importance of experimentation in the creative process?</li>
                                        <li>What benefits can arise from imposing limitations on creative work?</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Artistic expression can be stifled by rigid adherence to pre-existing rules and formats.</strong> The creative process flourishes when we challenge these conventions, exploring new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of our chosen mediums.</p>
                            <p><strong>Experimentation is the cornerstone of the creative journey.</strong> It involves embracing uncertainty, testing different approaches, and allowing the work to evolve organically. Through this process of trial and error, we gain invaluable insights that shape the final outcome.</p>
                            <p><strong>Constraints, while seemingly counterintuitive, can actually foster creativity.</strong> By imposing limitations on our work—whether it be a limited color palette or a specific structural rule—we force ourselves to think outside the box and discover innovative solutions.</p>

                                <li>"Embedded in each medium, there are sets of norms that restrain our work before we’ve even begun."</li>
                                <li>"We now enter the second stage, the Experimentation phase. Fueled by the initial hit of excitement at discovering a starting point, we play with different combinations and possibilities to see if any of them reveal how the seed wants to develop."</li>
                                <li>"The only way to truly know if any idea works is to test it. And if you’re looking for the best idea, test everything."</li>

                                <li>"In time, almost every artist finds themselves too close to the things they make. After endlessly working on the same piece, perspective is lost. We develop a kind of blindness."</li>
