This two-way relationship highlights the critical link between what we consume and our mental well-being. In the past, medical practitioners recognized a holistic connection between the body and mind. However, as medicine advanced and became more specialized, the focus shifted to individual organs, leading to a diminished understanding of the interconnectedness between various bodily systems, including the gut and brain.",
                            "Despite being physically separate, the gut and brain maintain constant communication through the vagus nerve, also referred to as the \"wanderer nerve.\" This nerve originates in the brain stem and extends to the gut, acting as a critical pathway for signals between these two organs.",
                            "Serotonin, a key chemical deficient in the brains of depressed and anxious people, plays a major role in regulating the gut-brain axis. Serotonin is one of the most buzzed-about brain chemicals because of its role in mood and emotion, but did you know that more than 90 percent of serotonin receptors are found in the gut?",
                            "Much like the intricate relationship between the gut and brain that forms the basis of this book, diet and mental health are inextricably linked, and the connection between them goes both ways: a dearth of good dietary choices leads to an increase in mental health issues, and mental health issues in turn lead to poor eating habits.",
                            "However, in the late nineteenth century, doctors changed their perspective. As medicine became more specialized, we lost track of the big picture, only looking at single organs to determine what was wrong and what needed fixing.",
                            "While your gut and brain are housed in different parts of your body, they maintain more than just a historical connection. They remain physically connected too. The vagus nerve, also known as the “wanderer nerve”, originates in the brain stem and travels all the way to the gut."
