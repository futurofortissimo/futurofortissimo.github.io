Today, due primarily to processed foods, we’re exposed to ten times more than our body was meant to handle, and it’s having devastating health consequences." (p. 209)</li>
                                        <li>"Most medical students are never taught about the impact that healthy nutrition can have on the course of illness, so they graduate without this powerful arsenal of knowledge." (p. 214)</li>
                                        <li>"Alcohol use appears to be the seventh leading risk factor for death globally, leading to millions of people dying annually and resulting in three times more healthy years of life lost than all illicit drug use combined." (p. 224)</li>
