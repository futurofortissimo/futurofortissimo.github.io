<h4 class="wp-block-heading active"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Advice no one wants to hear: <strong>“Your best time as a writer is when you are doing it for yourself and no one’s looking over your shoulder while you’re doing it.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em>
<ul>
<li>It’s much harder to write once you’ve had some success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Most writers feel 2 things at once:</strong> (1) feeling that they’re impostors; (2) believing that their work will resonate with the right reader&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make your creative decisions based on the impostor syndrome (that’ll make you a better writer), but make the business decisions based on the part of you that thinks this might be amazing</strong></li>
<li><strong>The New York Times list is not based on sales, it’s based on a handful of independent bookstores called reporting stores</strong></li>
<li>“Wool” was short and affordable, making it easy for people to finish and recommend</li>
<li><strong>Having a successful podcast, website, or big social media following can provide leverage in negotiations with publishers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Want to write a book? Write a little bit every day. Daily habits are critical</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hugh writes daily, even on weekends, before flights, or in an Uber</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hugh recommends reading books with beautiful prose to set a tone for writing sessions (Marcel Proust, anyone?)</li>
<li><strong>The prose in </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534430997"><strong>“This Is How You Lose the Time War”</strong></a><strong> will make you a better writer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tim is working on his first book project in six years</strong></li>
<li><strong>Authors, don’t use multiple pen names!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many authors mistakenly think that readers won’t follow them across genres<strong>. The brand is you</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hugh expects a big existential crisis: <strong>“I think AI will be one of the biggest challenges we go through because there’ll be an existential — we anthropomorphize our boats and our cars and our mechanical things, but imagine what we’re going to do when it’s robots and things we’re talking to.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>Hugh Howey is a mid-term optimist but a long-term pessimist</li>
<li><strong>Two potential outcomes for the universe’s fate are the “big crunch,” where gravity causes the universe to collapse, and the “heat death,” where entropy leads to the universe’s eventual decay</strong></li>
<li><strong>What Hugh learned sailing across the Pacific: We are all the same everywhere and we have to be creative in finding differences to talk about</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Intro</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugh Howey</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/hughhowey">@hughhowey</a>) is the<em> </em>New York Times bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wool-Hugh-Howey/dp/0358447844">Wool</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beacon-23-Hugh-Howey/dp/0544839633/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20">Beacon 23</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beacon-23-Hugh-Howey/dp/0544839633">Sand</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hugh-Howey/dp/1328767523/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20">Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hugh-Howey/dp/1328767523">Half Way Home</a>, and more</li>
<li>Tim and Hugh talk about self-publishing, the pricing logic behind his books, good writing practices, common mistakes creatives make, as well as the influence of AI on the industry, and existential questions about the future</li>
<li>Host: Tim Ferriss (<a href="https://twitter.com/tferriss">@tferriss</a>)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>00:52 – Wool’s Success: Most Reviewed on Amazon</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Most of what I’ve figured out as a writer I’ve learned as a reader.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>Hugh added an interview after the story to surprise readers</li>
<li>The interview had questions from readers and answers from Hugh</li>
<li>It was the first time readers heard Hugh’s voice directly</li>
<li>Hugh intentionally asked readers to review and share his book after the interview</li>
<li>Results? <strong>The year that “Wool” came out, it was the most reviewed and highest reviewed item on Amazon</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11:00 – Your Best Time as a Writer Is…</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>His first attempt to write was after reading “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” and “Ender’s Game” when he was 12-13 years old
<ul>
<li>It was mostly bad fanfiction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something he learned as a bookseller: <strong>“There are all these books on the bookshelves but for any reader who walked in there were only a few that would blow them away.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>He committed to writing in obscurity for 10 years to see what would happen</li>
<li>He told himself he would write 2 books a year for 10 years</li>
<li>The goal was to focus on improving craft without worrying about marketing or immediate success</li>
<li>Advice no one wants to hear: <strong>“Your best time as a writer is when you are doing it for yourself and no one’s looking over your shoulder while you’re doing it.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>It’s much harder to write once you’ve had some success</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>15:02 – Enjoying the Freedom of Self-Publishing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Initially, Hugh planned to give away his first book for free</li>
<li>Everyone’s dream was to get a publisher, and Hugh just wanted people to read the book</li>
<li><strong>“The day that I signed the contract to sign my rights over to that publisher was one of the worst days of my life. It was everyone else’s dream.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>Despite the excitement, signing away his rights felt wrong, as he was already planning sequels</li>
<li><strong>He eventually signed a deal with a small press, but the gut feeling persisted</strong></li>
<li>His agent advised against it but helped negotiate a print-only deal with Simon &amp; Schuster</li>
<li>The deal was for a five-year print-only term, after which Hugh would regain the rights</li>
<li>After five years, when the book was still successful, he regained the rights and went to auction again</li>
<li><strong>This unique setup allows him to have multiple opportunities to monetize the book and control its destiny</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>22:04 – Why Authors Should Strive for a Reader-First vs. Publisher-First Mindset</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For most writers, their relationship has always been with the publisher first</li>
<li>For Hugh, his relationship was with readers first</li>
<li><strong>Advice for people starting out:</strong> You have to have confidence in your work and write a book that you think one other human will find to be the best book they’ve ever read—not because it is objectively better, but because it finds the right audience</li>
<li><strong>Most writers feel 2 things at once:</strong> (1) feeling that they’re impostors; (2) believing that their work will resonate with the right reader&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Make your creative decisions based on the impostor syndrome (that’ll make you a better writer), but make the business decisions based on the part of you that thinks this might be amazing</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>24:22 – Hitting the NYT Best Sellers List With a Self-Pub Book</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hugh hit the New York Times list with a self-pub book, “Wool”. How is that possible?</li>
<li><strong>The New York Times list is not based on sales, it’s based on a handful of independent bookstores called reporting stores</strong></li>
<li>He thinks he got lucky that week that the gatekeepers weren’t paying attention</li>
<li>Retail distribution was through CreateSpace, Amazon’s print-on-demand service</li>
<li>Bookstores had to go through Ingram, an expanded distributor, to purchase the book</li>
<li>Hugh’s success was largely due to the significant number of copies sold monthly, around 50,000</li>
<li>Hitting the list isn’t necessary for a successful career</li>
<li>Before “Wool,” Hugh had completed five novels and another shorter work</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>27:44 – Pricing Logic Behind “Wool”</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Why did “Wool” capture people in the way that it did?</li>
<li>Hugh was very lucky that he started to publish at a time when e-readers and print-on-demand were around</li>
<li>“Wool” was short and affordable, making it easy for people to finish and recommend</li>
<li><strong>“I was charging 99 cents for the ebook and the little paperback, which I think only several hundred maybe got purchased before the cover changed, was like $4.99.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>Those little paperbacks now go for $1000</li>
<li>Despite Amazon’s pricing guidelines, Hugh chose to keep the price low to avoid negative reviews</li>
<li>He preferred reaching a wider audience over maximizing profits</li>
<li>Hugh eventually made the first part of “Wool” free to attract more readers and avoid one-star reviews</li>
<li>Serialization helped hook readers, with the complete series being equivalent to a 500-page novel, taking about 10 hours to read</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>31:00 – The Undersold Value of Worldwide Rights</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hugh doesn’t sell worldwide rights for his books</li>
<li>He was surprised by the success of foreign deals from Brazil and Germany</li>
<li><strong>Typically, authors sign deals giving publishers rights to everything, including foreign sales</strong></li>
<li>Publishers often make deals with foreign publishers before wiring money to authors</li>
<li>Foreign deals are usually term-limited, like five or seven years, and Hugh has renewed many of them</li>
<li>His agents handle deals in different regions like Europe and Asia</li>
<li>They advise him on which offers to accept, even if they’re not the highest-paying</li>
<li><strong>One example is a small Taiwanese publisher recommended by his Asian agent, which led to huge success</strong></li>
<li>Hugh values the work of agents, publishers, and bookstores, despite being known for self-publishing</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>33:57 – How Authors Can Find Deal Leverage Early On</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Authors need something to bargain with, such as a successful self-published book or a strong platform</li>
<li>Publishers are more willing to negotiate with authors who can offer a guaranteed readership and reduce their perceived risk</li>
<li><strong>Having a successful podcast, website, or big social media following can also provide leverage in negotiations</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>37:07 – Establishing a Daily Writing Habit</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>I hate writing, but I love having written</strong>.” – <em>Dorothy Parker</em></li>
<li><strong>Want to write a book? Write a little bit every day. Daily habits are critical</strong></li>
<li>Hugh writes daily, even on weekends, before flights, or in an Uber
<ul>
<li>He aims for 1,000 words per day</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hugh uses the word count feature in his writing software to track his progress and motivate himself to beat his previous word counts</strong></li>
<li>His daily writing practice began when he started reviewing books for a website, where he read and reviewed a book every day</li>
<li><strong>“I didn’t know how good this was going to be for my writing, but absorbing that much prose just made it so easy for me to tap into not only the ability to string words together but all the plot elements that I was absorbing from weeks and weeks and weeks of absorbing this many books.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>41:34 – Fiction That Inspires Better Writing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hugh recommends reading books with beautiful prose to set a tone for writing sessions (Marcel Proust, anyone?)</li>
<li><strong>The prose in </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534430997"><strong>“This Is How You Lose the Time War”</strong></a><strong> will make you a better writer</strong>
<ul>
<li>It was written by two authors who alternated back and forth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hugh took a few tries to complete <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tomorrow-novel-Gabrielle-Zevin/dp/0593321200">“Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow”</a>, but it paid off. He discovered it was the way he wanted to write</li>
<li>Anything by Amor Towles’ books is great. He’s one of the smartest human beings Hugh has ever met
<ul>
<li>There’s a short story collection by Towles this year called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Table-Two-Fictions-Amor-Towles/dp/0593296370">“A Table for Two”</a>. One short story in particular is the cleverest thing he ever read</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>45:27 – Collaboration vs. Writing Solo</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tim is working on his first book project in six years</strong></li>
<li>Initially, he gave up on the project after writing 72,000 words because of imposter syndrome. However, a friend kept bugging him to read it, prompting Tim to ask him for help</li>
<li>And so far it has been great writing with someone</li>
<li><strong>“The book is not done. Who knows where it will go? But I can say, at the very least, it has already partially succeeded. And I see that as such a tremendous unlock for myself.”</strong> – <em>Tim Ferriss</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>42:34 – Ways the Publishing Industry Protects the Status Quo</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tim will self-publish for his upcoming book project, and it will probably be a print-only deal</li>
<li>Print-only deals are off the table for bigger publishers</li>
<li>Hugh shares that a publisher who gave him a print-only deal got phone calls from all the other publishers blasting them</li>
<li>What surprised him is that publishers weren’t willing to do deals because of the stigma and the social pressure from other publishers</li>
<li>Why do the publishing deals at all? You can reach different readers&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>“You might not reach more readers because the pricing will be less appetizing in a lot of ways, but you’ll get in different distribution channels. So it opens up new avenues.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>55:47 – Common Mistakes Creatives Make</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trusting expertise can get you in trouble because the industry is changing all the time</strong></li>
<li>Hugh’s career took a turn when he trusted his gut about audiobooks, creating and launching audiobooks as an extra format</li>
<li><strong>“So trusting your gut is often going against the established wisdom and that can be really beneficial. There’s just so much change happening and you might have an idea no one else has had. So being your own expert I think is one of the keys.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li><strong>Authors, don’t use multiple pen names!</strong></li>
<li>Many authors think that readers won’t follow them across genres</li>
<li><strong>However, consolidating your identity under your real name can strengthen your brand. The brand is you</strong></li>
<li>Build a strong connection with your readers. Personal relationships with fans can last for years</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1:01:03 – AI’s Present-And-Future Impact</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>AI is changing book creation and publishing rapidly, similar to how electricity and computation have transformed various industries over time</li>
<li>New language models are less than a few years old, and we can’t predict their capabilities</li>
<li><strong>AI can help with creating cover art and get you professional-level results quickly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Traditional cover artists are still the best option for important projects, but AI is a good option for self-publishing</strong></li>
<li>There’s already been an influx of AI-generated books in self-publishing and platforms like Amazon set up restrictions</li>
<li><strong>“I think AI will be one of the biggest challenges we go through because there’ll be an existential — we anthropomorphize our boats and our cars and our mechanical things, but imagine what we’re going to do when it’s robots and things we’re talking to.”</strong> – <em>Hugh Howey</em></li>
<li>Hugh expects a big existential crisis when we realize what we do is computational and we are not that special</li>
<li>Our brains are large language models</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>01:10:11 – Mid-Term Optimist, Long-Term Pessimist</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hugh Howey is a mid-term optimist but a long-term pessimist</li>
<li><strong>Two potential outcomes for the universe’s fate are the “big crunch,” where gravity causes the universe to collapse, and the “heat death,” where entropy leads to the universe’s eventual decay</strong></li>
<li>While these scenarios are billions of years away, acknowledging the impermanence of existence can provide perspective on shorter-term issues</li>
<li>Short-term crises like environmental concerns, nuclear warfare, and cometary impacts have historically not posed existential threats</li>
<li><strong>Technologies that could pose existential risks:</strong> CRISPR genetic engineering, nanotechnology, or advanced battery storage</li>
<li>Do we have adequate safeguards for rapidly advancing potentially dangerous technologies?</li>
<li>The open nature of GPUs and open-source code is very challenging to regulate</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing profit over safety?</strong> Despite the potential risks, investment in companies developing these technologies continues to grow</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>01:26:21 – Free Will and Objective Moral Truth</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Hugh believes in objective moral truth but doesn’t know exactly what it is</li>
<li>He doesn’t believe in free will</li>
<li><strong>What Hugh learned sailing across the Pacific: We are all the same everywhere and we have to be creative in finding differences to talk about</strong></li>
<li>How can moral truth be subjective when we’re the same as a people?</li>
<li>The golden rule found in almost every ethical and religious system: treat others as you want to be treated</li>
