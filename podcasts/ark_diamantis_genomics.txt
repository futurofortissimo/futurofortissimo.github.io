1:00
welcome back everyone to FYI for your Innovation AR invests uh podcast I have
1:09
a very special guest uh with us today um and I will introduce him in a moment but
1:15
uh with me today uh is our chief investment strategist uh Charlie Roberts
1:22
who uh his background is um varied and
1:27
uh but who has made it his business over the years to understand and really be a
1:34
part of making the convergence between multiomics uh multiomics in the Life
1:40
Sciences space and uh artificial intelligence so uh ultimately with the
1:47
the hope of curing disease and diagnosing uh disease before it actually happened so uh welcome Charlie and Peter
1:56
diamandis and actually Charlie and Peter go a long way back um so Peter is the
2:03
founder many of you may know of uh xprize uh the founder of Singularity
2:09
University that's how I found uh Peter uh years ago and I just uh was so
2:15
inspired by his vision and uh thought it was so important H to educate the world
2:21
about Innovation and how it was going to transform our life uh so important that
2:26
I've taken a a leaf from his book and we're doing our small part in Middle
2:31
Schools uh with arcs research uh and uh Peter is um the author of four New York
2:40
Times Best Sellers so look those up uh and he is um very uh closely aligned and
2:49
um and very close to I would say Ray Kurtz um who helped him found
2:54
Singularity University uh and therefore is uh getting glimpses into the future by the
3:02
day which uh continue to astonish us and he's hard of a part of uh making it all
3:08
happen so thank you Peter for for joining us today of course Kathy it's good to be with friends yeah yeah so
3:16
well we we figured um we'd talk about some of your favorite subjects and uh
3:22
you know I'd love to start with um healthc care um actually we did a
3:30
podcast not too long ago Peter and uh we probably didn't spend enough time on
3:36
that so I and I know you're passionate about it uh every day that I get older I
3:41
get more and more passionate about it yes very motivating and uh uh so I'd
3:48
love to start there and actually uh Charlie given um your very important
3:54
role in making this world happen I'd love to uh hear YouTube talk about human
4:01
longevity and what is happening out there that excites you so much about the
4:07
possibilities especially around this convergence between and among Technologies so so I I differentiate um
4:16
Kathy and Charlie between uh health care because we don't have health care today we have sick care right just to be clear
4:23
uh we take care of people after they're sick um which is a complete reversal of
4:28
the way it should be we should have Healthcare which is a series of systems and products and services that keep you
4:34
healthy versus react to you after you're sick what I am interested in is Health
4:39
span extension or longevity and um for me that Journey started you know decades
4:45
ago I I was doing a joint um uh MD PhD program at Harvard Medical School in MIT
4:53
I bailed with a master's degree before finishing my PhD no no one's going to
4:58
call me doct doctor that's by the way where I was that's where I was roomies with Mike saor we were in the fraternity
5:04
together which was which was fun but uh when I was there I remember seeing a
5:10
long a television show on longlived sea life that boohead whales could live 200
5:15
years and Greenland sharks could live four or 500 years and I remember thinking to myself if they can live that long why can't we and I said it's either
5:23
a hardware problem or a software problem and we're going to have the ability uh
5:28
to to solve that and I personally believe that this is the decade um and there are four major
5:36
reasons I can go into that if you want but this is the decade where we're going to make a dent in uh extending the
5:42
healthy human lifespan right I've just launched $ 101 million Health span X
5:47
prize uh to try and reverse the ravages of Aging by 20 years but there's a lot
5:54
happening and it's really Ai and Quantum and biotech and all these things conver
5:59
converging right we talk a lot about convergence that is going to give us the ability to understand perhaps why we age
6:06
how to slow it stop it and perhaps reverse it and if we can I would posit it's the biggest Financial Market on the
6:14
planet yeah in terms of opportunities out there yeah H how far do you think we
6:21
can push this what are the limits and you know we might be able to cure all
6:27
kinds of diseases out there you know okay how do we die what what what happens just the hardware the hardware I
6:35
mean the way I think about this there's a couple of things uh one you know if you cure cancer or heart disease it only
6:42
extends the average lifespan some single digit number of years I wish it was more
6:48
but it's it's not you intercept some other degenerative diseases and other thing to realize is the body was never
6:54
designed to lift past age 30 100,000 years ago we would be pregnant by age 12
7:00
or 13 by the time we were 26 27 we were a grandparent and before food was
7:07
abundant the last thing you want to do was steal food from your grandchildren's mouths and therefore you would die give
7:13
your bits back and you pass on the genes so the question is what is possible the
7:19
longest live Human today on record is 122 I think the longest lived human in
7:25
the US today is 114 um and so people have this mental barrier that we can't get past that and
7:33
if we don't do anything yeah we're we're sort of stuck there but I think that
7:39
we're beginning to understand the root causes of aging and the ability to
7:45
interfere um and so that's that's what I'm heavily investing in working on uh
7:52
and for me it's my biggest moonshot right now space was my moonshot 30 years ago longevity is my moonshot today
8:00
which Technologies Peter are you most specifically excited about that you think really move the needle yeah so I
8:05
mean first off we have to realize that we now have the ability to sequence and then edit your genome so obviously
8:12
genome sequencing when Craig ventor sequenced his genome in 2001 it was $100 million in N months uh today it's on the
8:21
order of a couple hundred doar and seven hours but then the ability to use
8:27
crisper or any of the other Gene editing to go in there and you know change uh nucleotides um to
8:37
not accept what you were given um but you know it's going from evolution by
8:42
natural selection Darwinism to evolution by human Direction you know lots of ethical issues we can talk about those
8:48
for for a month straight but um it's in gene therapies being able to inject
8:55
specific genes additional copies of certain genes that are are beneficial
9:00
but then there are things like cellular medicine right uh where we can uh replenish your stem cell Supply right we
9:07
have a large population of stem cells when we're born and over the course of decades our stem cell populations come
9:14
down 100 fold a thousandfold in different parts augment your natural killer cells uh looking for cytic cells
9:22
I mean there's a number of these and I'll tell you the tech I'm excited about
9:27
is the one we haven't discovered yet it's what's coming with AI in Quantum and Quantum is going to become we are
9:33
quantum systems um quantum chemistry Quantum compute Quantum technologies
9:38
that are literally on our doorstep today Kathy we just announced a a Quantum
9:45
algorithm X prize jointly with Google which I'm excited about uh we
9:51
we've been anouncing we announced $120 million desalination X Prize last week a a $5 million Quantum algorithm prize
9:58
with Google today and it's going to be these technologies
10:03
that help us really understand what the heck is going on in our bodies so Peter
10:08
one one thing I I I have to back up just a little bit because I remember when
10:14
Craig Venter uh when he completed the sequence and and uh I guess the what
10:19
Francis Collins the NIH was the they were racing at the time uh now maybe
10:24
we're wrong but I think we did this arithmetic and so our clients have heard it uh heard it many times but uh just in
10:32
case we're wrong I want to go back you said $100 million by the US government spent billions yeah
10:41
$2.7 billion dollars to sequence the first whole Human Genome and it took 13
10:47
years Craig Venter it was 100 million in nine months um yes and and now we're
10:53
down to1 to $200 yeah five times faster than Moore's Law which is amazing it's been
11:00
demonetizing right and so we'll be at a point in the near future where every baby born will be sequenced you walk
11:06
into the hospital you're sequenced uh why because they want to know how you'll
11:11
metabolize a particular drug before you go under surgery or before you take a medication right because everybody
11:18
reacts to drugs differently or how epigenetics has impacted your genome you
11:24
know just yeah you know a fun thing Kathy is that I people go huh so I say
11:31
okay you get you get 2.3 billion letters from your mom sorry 3.2 letters 3.2 billion from your mom from your dad and
11:39
you have the same genome when you're born when you're 20 when you're 50 when you're 80 when you're 120 so why do you
11:46
look different right why why don't you have a six-pack when you're 80 and and it's not
11:54
the software you're running it is the epigenome it's it's which genes are on
12:00
and which genes are off and so we're discovering that right a lot of the work that's being done by David Sinclair and
12:06
George church and others um are beginning to say well can we reset your epig genome back to a more youthful
12:13
State and so far you know Charlie correct me if I'm wrong here but so far the evidence looks like yes we can
12:20
manipulate iGo yeah and look I think it's there some really interesting work has come here from things like twin
12:26
studies where twins separated at Birth of have the same genome but they can diverge as much as up to about 10 years
12:34
by the sort of the sixth seventh eth decade of life in their actual age in
12:39
terms of true biological age whether that's measured by time to death which is obviously ultimately the the
12:44
biological age or or with some of the clocks like the Horvath clock out of UCLA that shows you pretty pretty
12:51
accurately what the biological ages by using this epigenetic clock with these differentially methylated genes up and
12:57
down across across genome and I I think that's a great segue actually Peter into one of the one of the Technologies be
13:04
very interested in your your take on this whole space but that that's obviously been coming more emergent in
13:10
the last few years with a few big funding splashes is is around the whole yamanaka factor or that extended way of
13:18
potentially modulating the EP genome and obviously for for for listeners the
13:23
yonaka got the Nobel Prize in 2012 for identifying the four transcription factors which could drive any cell
13:29
essentially to becoming an induced plent stem cell ipsc and now you've got a few interesting companies like I guess Alto
13:36
laabs is very welln um backed by by Yuri Milner I think and Jeff Bezos and then you've got new limit which is
13:44
smaller exactly Brian Armstrong and and several I think there are now more than a handful of other companies going along
13:50
that same sort of pathway and I think looking for some something akin to the
13:55
amaka factors obviously you can't use all the amaka factors because some of them potentially put you down a kind of
14:00
more of an oncogenic route but yeah if you come across if you got interest in that space Peter do you think oh yeah a
14:05
a huge amount so I mean you know Davidson Clare published uh some work on the on the cover of like Nature and
14:12
Science I mean some incredible work right his 13ear summary of where he was able to uh accelerate the Aging of mice
14:19
and then reverse the aging by giving them three out of the four yamanaka factors and removing the anagenic
14:25
transcripton factor and was able to reverse um basically uh Aging in in the retin and
14:33
optical nerve now what's interesting you know that's in a mouse and you know we we all read about all of these amazing
14:39
longevity stuff going on in mice we'd expect mice to be living 500 years by now but um what's more interesting is
14:47
he's moved one of his companies has moved the work into primates which is of course one step uh much closer to us and
14:55
then the these are you're using gene therapies to deliver these these factors
15:02
and a lot of people are concerned that Gene therapies are expensive and is
15:09
longevity going to be a rich person's um uh you know option two things um worth
15:17
noting one is a conversation with George church and he said you know listen if
15:22
you're if you're giving a gene therapy for a rare disease um uh it can be half
15:29
a million to $2 million doar per therapy and because the number of of clients
15:35
number of patients is is small it's a rare disease but if you look at the RNA
15:43
um vaccines that we had uh from fizer and Mna those were Gene therapies
15:50
effectively and they cost you know single dollars to manufacture per dose because we manufactured them in the
15:56
hundreds of millions or billions so Gene can be cheap the other thing that's going on is David Sinclair has been
16:04
speaking about publicly uh a cocktail of molecules not Gene therapies that he
16:11
believes can reverse epigenetic age anyway it's the biggest Market in the in
16:16
the world more capital is Flowing this every year uh people have figured out you can't take it with you so yeah so I
16:24
I do have a another question and um as you say a lot of capital is Flowing
16:31
toward this space certainly in the private markets but capital in the public markets has been treated very
16:38
badly in this space this awful I mean it's it's astonishing it's the the
16:43
multiomic space broadly has been our worst performing space and we've been
16:49
our strategies have performed better than the certainly last year uh than the
16:56
health care space so Market's starting to differentiate but boy when we go into
17:02
a risk off phase in the market where you know there's some reticence out there um
17:09
any any companies that are investing heavily in this space um are
17:15
torched um and I just wonder you know I what I want to do I have to I have to
17:21
remind my own team since I've been through so many of these cycles that we going to go through cycles and there'll
17:28
be more risk on cycles for example where uh you would think nothing but this
17:35
space is working so I need to reassure our client base generally and uh
17:41
investors generally uh that uh it it has not always been this way this is very
17:48
unusual but what is fascinating is we're on the threshold of all of these breakthroughs they are happening they
17:55
are happening uh this is not you know dreaming 5 to 10 years out it's now and
18:04
so when do you think uh and maybe May I'll ask both of you this but when do
18:10
you think uh we'll see that aha moment I just to give you a a sense of how bad
18:17
the mood had been uh when I think her name was Allison or Ally the young girl
18:24
in the UK who was cured of leukemia after six months with you know B editing
18:30
right or Alissa exactly yes Alissa you know it didn't even make any waves this
18:37
was late 22 uh last year we got the first
18:42
approvals for um for Gene editing for beta phemia and CLE cell disease both us
18:49
and uh which is amazing this is like miraculous miraculous Godlike right and
18:55
those those stocks are starting to respond but but uh if if you really map
19:02
out over a 5 to 10 year period uh what is likely to happen to those stocks um
19:09
you know there are next Genentech which started the boom of the biotech revolution in the 80s and which caused
19:17
huge increases in returns uh to R&D investing um I'm wondering if this $2
19:25
million treatment conversation for rare diseases has just become a showstopper
19:33
investors are saying H you know they'll never be reimbursed for that or is that
19:39
what's going on I I listen I'm in I am personally on the board of two of those
19:46
public companies that got hammered uh cellularity and vaccin and you know everybody's been slashed by tenfold
19:53
20-fold it's insane um and at the end of the day I think what is going on is the
20:00
market is solely responding to profits and revenues and a lot of Biotech as you
20:06
know is is went public on the come it went public on future potential revenues
20:12
and future potential profits and the market has is that's gone out of phase
20:18
as you said these are just Cycles but these companies are you know these
20:23
companies that have been uh hit so hard I mean ridiculous ly hard are going to
20:31
deliver on revenues and profits and I think that we're in the most extraordinary biotech buying opportunity
20:37
on the marketplace right now okay and Charlie any anything you'd like to add
20:43
no I would I think I would Echo those thoughts I mean I think with a lot of these things the actual change is kind
20:49
of later later but greater right people often expect a sort of slightly
20:54
sublinear curve and reality is it's much more like this and it's nearly a vertical takeoff when it starts to really turn and happen and I think you
21:01
know look at madna right as an example um what it did yeah absolutely and then
21:08
we see well we're seeing it with obviously the gp1s and things as well when these things do start just
21:14
delivering and being used at real scale and sometimes you see these sort of second order benefits coming through as we're seeing with the gp1s as well and I
21:21
think to Peter's point we're going to have an unprecedent the fusion and maybe we talk about AI in a minute of AI plus
21:28
sequencing plus other SE analogous to sequencing but but single cell much
21:35
improved proteomics all of these things start to give us a much greater insight into causal biology because that's been
21:41
the huge missing piece in really the history of all of healthcare yeah sorry Kathy I was gonna
21:48
say one of the companies I I built recently with Tony Robbins is is called Fountain life and uh we built centers
21:55
we've got four centers we built we have a Runway to build out 30 centers around the world and these are um going these
22:02
are the most advanced Diagnostics and therapeutic centers you go and you're uploaded we digitize you 150 gigabytes
22:09
of data you know uh full body MRI brain brain vasculature coronary C with AI 120
22:16
biomarkers metabolomics microbiome genomics everything to answer two
22:22
questions is there anything going on in your body you should know about right I ask people all the time like audience is
22:29
anybody here know that they're perfectly well there's nothing going on in your body and of course no one raises their
22:35
hand because you have no idea you know the body is amazingly good at hiding disease um I'll give you the numbers in
22:42
a second but the second question we ask is if there's nothing going on great what's likely to get you because you can
22:49
make those predictions and how do you stop it or slow it down and uh what we
22:55
find is 2% of people going through have a cancer right now they don't know about
23:01
2 and a half% have an aneurism they know about 14.4% have either neurocognitive
23:06
metabolic cardiovascular disease and the body is just amazingly good at
23:14
compensating what age range what age range are you are are the the people going through the centers are typically
23:20
30 to 80 those numbers are for people typically in their 50s and
23:25
60s yeah and and before before we started the podcast I love the way you
23:31
summarized uh what's going to happen just to wrap up Healthcare in a sense to the diagnostic
23:40
and uh surgery spaces yeah so my view here
23:45
is Diagnostics and and surgical Therapeutics to solve a problem right
23:52
are both going to massively demonetize and democratize the best diagnosticians will be your AI right right we're all
23:59
going to be having wearables insides implantables consumables that are measuring everything in our body it'll
24:05
be relatively cheap uploading the data to your AI my aura ring my CG my cus
24:11
glucose monitor and so forth and and it won't be going in quarterly like we do
24:16
right now but every day catching stuff at the very beginning but the interesting thing is what happens in
24:23
surgery and I have a number of my family members are surgeons I I go them with this all the time I said you know the
24:28
best surgeons in the world are going to be robots um why because first of all uh do
24:37
you know the question you ask if you if you're interviewing a surgeon what's the number one thing you ask a surgeon if
24:42
you have to do a surgery of some type how many times have you done this it is exactly that my I would add
24:49
how many times did you do it this morning so the surgeon the surgeon who has done the most cases of that surgery
24:57
and has seen the most variations is the most skilled but here's what's going to go on right a surgeon may see you know
25:05
5,000 10,000 20,000 cases during their career but imagine a a AI robotic
25:12
platform that there are thousands of robots all sharing the same information
25:17
just like a Tesla car when when an upload occurs they all get it so a
25:23
particular malformation seen by one robot is now known by all the surgical robots M right and and there's no the
25:31
robot didn't have too much coffee or didn't have a fight with their boyfriend or girlfriend last night you know didn't get too little sleeve it can see an
25:38
infrared or ultraviolet there's no Jitter and what is the cost of that surgery it's the capex of the robot the
25:46
cost of electricity and that's it yeah you know okay so this is a beautiful segue into
25:53
Robotics and AI actually and you know just trying to figure out you know with
26:00
Elon Musk and Optimus and you know the the the possibilities here how
26:08
essential we're trying to figure out uh what is coming first the the human
26:14
advances in AI or advances in you know robot technology or they're happening at
26:22
the same time you know is is this another convergence we're seeing the
26:27
physical and the digital world come together in profound ways and is that what's happening effectively I you know
26:33
I've been building robots since high school buil my first robot in in ninth grade and I've been building them ever
26:38
since uh not in the last 20 years but throughout college and grad school and
26:44
uh you can see some advances in Material Sciences in artificial muscle materials
26:49
and sensors and better batteries and better Imaging and so forth but
26:56
99% of the advances now are all AI it's the ability for the S robot's a sensor
27:01
suite and an actuator suite and the ability for that robot to parse the information and make the proper
27:09
movements is all um sitting on top of of gpus um our robots have gotten brains uh
27:16
and it's a it's a beautiful beautiful thing you know I was talking to Brett Adcock uh from figure all right um my
27:23
Venture funds and investor there and he was showing me and they they just got like uh a large you know like 700
27:31
million or thereabouts um from a number of investors to move it forward and he
27:37
was showing me how how they had uh figure which is the name of the robot
27:44
and the name of their company watch a person making a cup of coffee in curig
27:49
and and watching them 30 times just repeat repeat repeat and in a multimodal
27:55
mode it was able then to parse it into understanding the parts the steps
28:01
and the Motions required and then it did it perfectly we saw that video it is available out there I would suggest
28:07
anybody go look at it to see you know how how how the the fingers are now
28:14
operating and so precisely it's it's really marvelous it's going to be it I think
28:21
it's so listen I live in Santa Monica it's where I'm broadcasting from and we have these little uh six- wheeled robots
28:27
that are running around the streets and are delivering food right and a Lo local
28:34
shop puts it in and it runs down and you can order it that way and the first time you see it it's like oh wow that's cool
28:40
I wonder how it's crossing the street and you're you're super enticed and then after you've seen it a hundred times
28:45
it's like get out of the damn way it's true it's I think that's gonna
28:52
happen with our humanoid robots too yeah that's so interesting yeah we get humans
28:58
get used to stuff so fast right so when you say that what are you saying I mean
29:04
they're going to be able to do things much better than human beings can if they're repetitive and you know involve
29:10
a lot of precision and so forth right so we'll be happy about that they'll be taking all of these uh these uh you know
29:18
jobs that nobody really wants to do and the term is called the jobs that are dull dangerous or dirty is when I I
29:25
think about them but you know I know that my my niece and my
29:32
brother-in-law who are surgeons both like being surgeons I think they'd want to stay being surgeons not have the
29:37
robot take their surgery job so there will be that going on um I'm just
29:43
thinking about the first time we start to see humanoid robots walking down the street walking the dog or making package
29:49
deliveries I mean that's gonna be fascinating uh what have you heard Kathy
29:54
as the projection on the number of robots we're going to see out there in the real world well um we
30:02
are do you know how low the base is right now of robots I think uh if I
30:10
think there are well Amazon for the first year uh it it doubled its robots
30:17
to roughly a Million last year and cut employment for the very first time by
30:24
maybe 100,000 and we think this year the number of robots will pass the number of employees at Amazon so and they've been
30:33
very Progressive on this front but if you look at the industrial robot space
30:38
out there it's at a very low base and if Amazon is any example we're going to be
30:44
shocked at how many robots are going to be do now they're not going to be humanoid robots some will be just pick
30:50
and place you know so so so you know it depends what you mean by that um uh but
30:58
we're we're trying to size that opportunity ourselves and and and you know robots if you think about it
31:04
autonomous vehicles are robots and we're still trying to get those to work that Tesla has five or six million of them
31:11
out in the world right I have I have two of them a model three and a model y so I
31:18
think I think we're going to turn around and and kind of say oh okay that was the
31:23
evolution towards robotics that that vehicle which begs another question we're still trying to get autonomous
31:31
taxis Robo taxis really working at scale uh and of course Elon famously and in
31:38
his last quarterly call it was very interesting he did not make a prediction but I think since
31:44
2016 he's uh been making a prediction that would be within a a year or two uh
31:49
now that he's not making the prediction maybe it will is about to happen who knows because slowly slowly slowly then
31:56
all at once that's as you know very well uh the the history of Technology but it
32:01
is s taking so long to to get a fully scaled uh autonomous platform I mean we
32:08
expected it initially in 22 uh now we're saying late this year
32:14
next year and we do see Tesla starting to gear up from the way uh from its job
32:21
postings but um you know is this is it again no no no yes sort of like his his
32:30
Landing Rob slowly slowly and all at once that's a great title for a book
32:35
yeah you know the number I heard uh from uh from Brett and I think from vode kosa
32:42
was as many as 10 billion by 2040 like as many humanoid robots as humans yes s
32:51
which is amazing right I think about how many cars there are in the world and I had to Google that the other day and
32:57
it's under a billion cars which surprised me yeah um so more robots which is why Tesla is saying you know
33:04
this is a much bigger opportunity for us yes right than than cars it be
33:09
interesting to see as well the I think there are a lot of a lot of folks at the moment are sort of thinking what does
33:15
the future look like where everyone has an an AI that not necessarily a digital twin although maybe that too but an AI
33:22
that is their coach and their counselor and their friend and just their Helper and whether that ends up becoming
33:27
embodied in their robot in that that's paired with them or whether it's a separate thing or whether we have a whole dinner dinner table of different
33:33
AIS I know I know folks like mman who wrote yeah wrote The Coming wave he's got this thought with inflection I mean
33:39
I'm I am uh I'm convinced we are all gonna have a version of Jarvis right
33:44
we're GNA have and Jarvis is my favorite um AI model because I I believe in fact
33:50
we're going to have and Jarvis will be our interface to the world whatever you need done you speak to Jarvis it can if
33:57
you if you're sitting in an F35 jet Jarvis please taxi and take off and fly
34:02
to 10,000 ft it knows how to interface it's got the ultimate API Library if you would um but what's really going to be
34:09
interesting you know I love playing uh convergence on elon's companies is
34:15
neuralink and Optimus right right so I want to plug my visual auditory in
34:21
muscle in my you know homunculus my my uh my sensory in motor cortex
34:29
uh through neuralink into a robot that's going to be very doable and I can I can
34:35
walk down the streets of Tokyo from Santa Monica uh on the other side of the planet maybe speed of light's gonna
34:42
screw that up a little bit okay details details what about the
34:47
three-way convergence Peter with the neuralink Optimus and the xplatform and just having all those trillions of
34:54
tweets into your brain at the same time yeah well you know listen you mentioned
35:00
I I I get it and and Kathy you mentioned Ray kwell who has been a a dear mentor
35:07
and and co-founder and partner we've started a couple companies together and you know he made the prediction of AGI
35:14
whatever AGI means by 2029 and people used to laugh at them and now they're
35:20
you know they're pretty sold that it's in that window um but he also made the prediction of high bandwidth brain
35:27
computer interface by 2033 yeah no I am fascinated because um
35:34
in 2019 if you take a look this was 2019 a long time after Ry made that
35:41
prediction but 2019 um if you look at the forecast of
35:47
futurists or or people who claim to be futurists um the time to AGI in 2019 was
35:56
80 years years today on average today it's eight years you know after the
36:05
massive GPT breakthroughs um how did Rey get that right because even we and we were
36:12
pushing the envelope we thought and we were you know much sooner than 80 years
36:17
but how did Ry nail that what what was that I mean I read his book but I just
36:23
cannot remember I probably wasn't taking it as seriously then but I think it's his it's his time machine
36:30
that allowed him to do that so I mean so what Ray is doing is looking at I mean exponential curves are are very
36:37
predictable and he was he's looking at the number of neuronal Connections in
36:42
the human brain right we have a 100 billion neurons 100 trillion synaptic connections and he's estimating um the
36:50
if you were gonna if you were going to Model A A synaptic Connection by virtue
36:56
of a a unit compute how quickly that was that was moving and that's about the best an
37:03
answer I can give you for my from my memory but he those are his his projections and he just said 2029 now he
37:10
made that prediction in 1999 I know I know and I'm telling you in
37:17
2019 the the futurists were saying 30 years from now and now they're all
37:23
walking it back and saying basically he was right now what does that mean what
37:28
what is life going to be like then Peter Well in in what in uh post AGI or post
37:36
brain computer interface so here's a question for you right so there's something very interesting happened that
37:41
no one's talking about uh which is we basically just blasted through the the
37:51
passing of the touring test without even noticing I mean no one said taada we did
37:56
it or look what just happened and so forth it's like it's in the rearview mirror right no one argues that that
38:02
that the touring test as originally designed um and expressed has been
38:08
passed a long time ago right at for people who don't know maybe you just restate what that is so Alan Allan
38:14
touring um had had a con wrote a paper that said when will we know that we have
38:22
artificial intelligence and he said if you could be sitting at a teletype and
38:27
typing at something either a human or an AI and having a conversation by by text
38:34
back and forth back and forth back and forth and you can't tell whether it is a human or a machine typing at you because
38:43
you ask it whatever question how you're feeling today what you have for breakfast and it's answering in a way
38:48
then if you can't tell then then there's no difference between that human and
38:53
that Ai and that become known as the touring test and of course today today not only can we type it at these things
39:00
I have on my my moonshot podcast I've done a number of pod I did a podcast with a uh Peter bot a virtualized
39:08
version of me and with a few other AIS where the conversation is shockingly
39:17
real and in fact Peter bot's better than I am in the conversations and I'm like
39:23
I'm jealous but and so we passed a extraordinary version of the touring
39:29
test so the question is when we get to AGI artificial general intelligence which is yet kind of
39:35
undefined I've never heard a really good definition other than human level intellect but a lot of AIS today are
39:42
much better than humans at so many different things I guess it generalized intelligence like it can it can drive
39:48
your car and it can fold your clothes and it can do your homework and it can
39:53
take uh the the gr or the SAT and get and pass it or doctors or
39:59
lawyers I think the other uh definition is it can put together a model car uh in
40:07
in you know one that is almost impossible for a human being to to and as you say with the Turing Tas you know
40:14
you're you're you're now talking for two hours and you have no idea whether you're talking to a human or a robot
40:19
that that sort of thing so it's able to do everything which by the way no human can do right so all of a sudden that
40:27
isn't really AGI it's it's digital super intelligence because it's beyond any single human it's it's you're asking it
40:34
now if it can do all those things you probably have to have a collection of a thousand experts to be able to do all
40:40
those things and you're just saying AGI so that's I call BS on that but yeah um
40:46
so what what's going to happen uh you know Sam wman famously said people are
40:51
going to be freaked out for about you know 3 days and then they'll go back to normal so but the interesting thing is
40:58
going to be uh when do we see new
41:04
companies and new breakthrough so what I'm excited about is physics and
41:09
medicine and chemistry and biology insights that no human has been able to
41:14
parse and all of a sudden new materials are being invented new understandings of
41:20
why and how we age or you you know unified field theories and things are coming out of like oh my God that's
41:26
amazing that will be exciting for me a lot a lot of the interestingly as you
41:31
say getting a core understanding of actual physics is is has not been something demonstrated yet but is you
41:37
know considered a next Frontier but even as basic planning is something that the AIS to date have not these this is
41:43
probably the coming year or two of these agentic systems that can really form a future state plan of the world and then
41:49
work towards that and I think that's going to be some of the most exciting things we see in AI probably in the coming one to two years from so the for
41:56
us you know listen I'm I'm on my 25th company and I love starting companies and um I you know it's going to be a lot
42:05
of fun to be able to brainstorm within Ai and start companies and you know they're going to be the predictions of
42:11
the first unicorns that are built with you know a you know a girl a dog and an
42:17
AI come together and form a company and I was thinking about one thing the other day and I mentioned in my in my podcast
42:24
I wonder which country will be the first country to allow an AI to incorporate in
42:31
its Nation on its own because I think that will be interesting so I think what
42:36
happens then is all the AIS incorporate their startups in that country and just
42:42
the country has to tax tax those AI startups I think it's a I think for the
42:47
right Nation that's a big idea you know where that is starting to happen it is
42:53
not quite like that but El Salvador it's focused on AI well both Bitcoin and AI
43:00
it's attracting AI Talent down tax-free uh and so forth so yeah we're we're
43:07
definitely uh keep keeping our eye on that one one question though on AI big
43:13
debate out there you actually have a phrase for it a boomer or Doomer yeah so I just I just
43:21
finished my I have a big event every year uh called the abundance Summit it's
43:26
singular University's highest level event and I run it year round it's 500 you you were there at the Abundant
43:32
amazing it's amazing the energy level there energy level people from all
43:38
around the world it's amazing yeah our theme next year is Convergence and you're going to be joining me there I'm
43:43
excited about that looking forward to that past the past year uh just now um
43:49
it's uh the theme was uh the AI great debate and so uh we brought together Ray
43:56
KW and Jeffrey Hinton and Eric Schmidt and guom Verdon and uh got a whole a
44:03
whole bunch of of folks I'm forgetting Imad mustak uh and we were debating And
44:11
discussing are you a boomer we need to go as fast as possible AI is the single
44:16
most important thing that that humanity is going to need to solve problems and to solve um actually white hat black hat
44:24
you know issues or are you Doomer which is like slow down we don't understand it
44:30
we got to slow down and one of the comments made by a gentleman uh
44:36
Alexander wezner gross was he said okay uh that's one dimension to look at
44:42
this which is Boomer versus Doomer but it's missing a dimension that's very important which he said is it the
44:48
dimension is coupled versus uncoupled what does that mean he said are we
44:54
coupling the future of AI with the future of humanity or is AI going to
45:01
take off and leave us behind right so this is the movie Her
45:07
Right Where AI say bye we're kind of bored here and and so the coupling would
45:13
occur on the back end of brain computer interface neuralink uh there's a whole
45:20
uh number of amazing BCI company I just had two brain computer interface companies presenting at at uh at the
45:27
abundance uh abundance 360 uh Summit this year so I
45:33
think you know all of this is happening like right now Kathy this is the most exciting time to be alive oh man I mean
45:40
and and what is so interesting and being in the equity markets and watching uh
45:46
the fear of change I mean there's uh the there are we we already talked about the
45:52
multiomic space but you know there are a few stocks the mag six they've taken Tesla away and I'm kind of happy about
45:59
that I I don't want to be in the mag anything you know meaning mag six you
46:04
know I think there you know I think Google could be disrupted you know and so Apple could be disrupted you know AI
46:12
we've been watching apple on AI uh for a long time really trying to figure out
46:18
would it when and would it uh finally uh
46:25
debut uh its AI stripes with an autonomous vehicle the ultimate mobile
46:30
device they shut it down right and they've just shut it down so you know it's really interesting to see this pass
46:38
them by in a sense but you know I don't want to write them off that when you know when Steve Jobs was around uh many
46:45
people wrote it off as a cell phone player and of course it redefined the space now Steve Jobs is no longer with
46:52
us so uh we shall see what happens but I mean I would never I would never uh bet
46:58
against Elon I think Tesla has got massive headp space and I I think I think I believe exactly as you do with
47:06
with AI with robotaxis and with Optimus and with everything going on there um uh
47:12
Apple I have to you know listen Apple has got to be I mean they're the most
47:18
secretive company on the planet um and so a world that is valuing transparency
47:23
and open source much more yeah and so they have to be you know I'm assuming
47:29
iPhone 16 or 17 will will debut a version of Siri that can finally spell
47:34
Kathy correctly when I text you you know instead of five other way it's like it's
47:39
like listen her name is right there in the two line would you please notice where that is is that why you don't
47:46
spell my name correctly I'm k um yeah but you said you mentioned
47:52
something which is interesting that most people fear the future yeah they do do
47:57
they don't and especially if a company's willing to invest in it they really hate that and guess what it's not going to
48:04
happen unless they invest aggressively and they need to invest aggressively now in order to in order to win in this new
48:11
world you know that is um the reason I started uh my abundance 360 membership
48:18
in Summit 12 years ago it's my 12th year now was a conversation I had with a gentleman Dan Sullivan where he said
48:25
people fear the future and you don't and you said you need to show people why
48:30
they should be excited about the future right and so for me um these converging Technologies uplift Humanity ABS they
48:38
enabling us to have access to all the food water energy Healthcare education everything and making the world a better
48:44
place and um I I think we should be excited about the future um it's the
48:50
most exciting time ever to be alive yeah and you know what I what I see in the public world public asset management is
48:59
really a Reliance on the past they're quite happy to be in the mag six and uh
49:06
you know Nvidia has you know all praises to to Jensen Wong it you know it he saw
49:12
the future well before a lot of others and deserves to be there but I do think
49:18
that that even even with Invidia the competition uh with now that the aha
49:24
moment has taken place you you do of course of AMD but you've got the hyperscalers the cloud companies
49:30
developing each of them their own chips you've got Tesla with its own chip so I
49:36
I think this idea that Nvidia has and don't uh don't you know discount
49:42
Intel Intel is absolutely working in this direction uh Cerberus is you know a
49:48
a a chip company very focused here as well so and
49:54
China very interestingly yeah yeah China you know someone I was speaking to
50:00
someone at the IMF uh last week and I was trying to uh noodling through with
50:05
them you know China what's going to happen here how does it change the subject from its property implosion and
50:12
debt and you know overwhelming debt to something else well there hopefully it's
50:18
not Taiwan hopefully it is innovation and he said Oh you mean like when in the
50:25
70s uh and 880s we banned Japan or not we didn't ban we put sanctions on Japan
50:32
autos because they were you know they were basically dumping cheap Autos in
50:38
the US and so what did Japan do it changed the subject it actually develop
50:43
some of the most sophisticated and high quality automobiles in in the world and I just wonder if this is going to happen
50:50
uh with China and chips our our analysts would suggest it will be difficult
50:56
because asml is the gating factor and a asml is
51:01
not uh selling its equipment to China but uh we shall see very interesting
51:06
China has an extraordinary number of scientists and technologists and they
51:11
have a national a very focused National will yes they have the ability to to
51:17
mobilize Capital rewrite regulations mobilize scientists and technologists
51:22
and say and do their own Manhattan projects so I I would would not ever
51:27
count against them and a friend of mine who CEO one of the large Uh current
51:32
language uh large language model AI companies his statement to me was that the llms coming out of China have
51:40
surpassed the us at this point yeah we've seen a few one was called Chi I think um uh open source interestingly
51:48
and on our open source performance line so we we've uh been mapping out closed
51:54
Source uh performance increase of uh large language models and open-
52:00
Source large language mod models their performance increase and what we've seen is while open source is still below
52:08
performance its slope its rate of increase is faster um interestingly we
52:13
got Claude 3 out its performance and it out has um it has finally topped GPT 4
52:21
and that's the first time we've seen that so that's interesting one last um one last topic oh Peter I was G inject
52:28
one topic there if I if I may which is we didn't you know when when you were on my moonshots podcast we didn't talk
52:34
about Sora right and and sora's come out and when I saw that the first day my
52:39
tweet was you know Hollywood rest in peace right I
52:44
mean is Shifting yeah it it truly is and
52:49
we're GNA reinvent in the entertainment Marketplace yes and what also the biggest challenge of course is
52:57
we're going to start to reinvent what truth means you know we're going to go
53:02
from uh seeing as believing which is what we have all of humanity to I think
53:08
uh uh defaulting to distrust yes already see that with young people is this a
53:14
fake yeah first reaction yeah yeah so very interesting um and uh okay last
53:22
topic uh very timely uh Bitcoin has come all the rage I I just talked about
53:28
people being fearful of the future well uh they were right after FTX but that
53:34
was a great that would have been a great place to to buy buy when there's blood in the street
53:41
and so here we are up close to 70,000 uh what do you think I am I've been buying
53:49
um I remember when you were on my stage at the at abundance 360 two years ago
53:55
what two years AG yeah and you were saying we're going to within the five years we'll get to a
54:00
million um and we're on that trajectory so I'm a huge Bitcoin proponent um I
54:07
just had Michael saor on stage with me right he's one of the largest uh Bitcoin
54:13
maximalist um and evangelist evangelist and in in the most beautiful way he
54:19
communicates it right as and it's really the financial layer on the internet it is it is a equalizing abundance enabling
54:28
force uh on Humanity so I mean I talk about the 6ds of exponential whenever
54:35
you digitize something in the beginning it's deceptive then it becomes disruptive and it dematerializes
54:40
demonetizes and democratizes and that's Bitcoin to the financial industry yeah
54:46
and uh you've been saying that forever uh congratulations on on your Bitcoin uh
54:51
ETF I mean see as like the is it the second or third largest right now so uh
54:56
we are number three um if you exclude gbtc so gbtc its fee is still so high it
55:05
has seeded a lot of share so we're number three so David against h two
55:11
goliaths and so thrilled to be there you know conratulations yeah no and and we
55:17
do you know we we are not going to make any money on this I guarantee you and we didn't intend to but exactly as you say
55:25
Peter this is the uh the uh Financial
55:30
superhighway and the most important thing to us is that anyone can gain
55:36
exposure to it because um it is revolutionary we call it a a a monetary
55:44
Revolution uh Financial Services Revolution and uh a new asset class
55:50
which is we haven't had a truly new asset class since the 1600s equities
55:56
what was that equities in the 1600s yeah I mean people
56:01
call people call Arc a new asset class which is think about how crazy that is we're just investing in the future isn't
56:08
that what investing is supposed to be yes it is and I I I I love that and you
56:14
know we haven't so it's interesting right um we've started now institutions
56:19
have started to buy in and governments are just putting their toes in the water yes it's already irreversible and
56:25
governments will come in but we haven't even started talking about Bitcoin
56:31
applications right the use of Bitcoin as a financial layer and when it starts being pulled into every part of our
56:39
lives and it's the it's a backbone that's you know that we don't see but it's being
56:45
used it's amazing it is amazing yeah yeah a great I I what a time to be alive
56:53
and I could talk to you all day long Peter thank you so much Charlie had to leave but uh we both thank you so much
56:59
this enjoyable and looking forward to to many more of these conversation I think
57:04
we'll have a lot of them because so much is going to change so quickly I think uh
57:10
heads are going to spin let's do it on a regular basis I'd love like a quarterly catch up together that would be very
57:16
cool that would be wonderful we would love that okay Peter all right take care now byebye now bye Arc believes that the
