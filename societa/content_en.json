Number of steps. Instagram followers. ff subscribers.\nAt the same time, more and more renunciations. More and more no. Alcohol. Tobacco. Drugs. Added sugars. Aspartame. Processed foods.

At a sporting level, I could easily feel 'arrived', since only the 2-3% of those who finish a marathon, an already small subpopulation, manage to stay under 3h.\nBut, having shared the feat on social media, a friend's reaction was: 'the next one then? 2 hours and 30?'.\nThe reiterated message: continuous growth and infinite limits (always more implausible even for social media and the algorithms that govern them). All our egos crushed.",

I want it to be weaker and more dampened so that I can live much more in the reality of every day. To accept nature and its limits. To appreciate the present moment, as children do.\nNaval Ravikant\nBrad Stulberg, former McKinsey optimizer and Peak Performance writer, now proposes the concept of groundedness. Which is then the ideal of Verga's oyster adapted to our distracted and anxious days.\nBook Summary: The Practice of Groundedness by Brad Stulberg\nHere are the proposed exercises:\nAccept your current state, remind yourself that you are doing your best to be the best.\nOnce you recognize the state of things, anchor yourself to them, committing to focus your attention on the present.\nHelp yourself by seeking movement, action, which often accompanies flow; so the mind will not wander to the past or plan the future (even if fortissimo).\nScience seems to promote this message of anchoring to the present: the activity of the posterior cortex, connected to anxiety, decreases when we accept the situation we are in. As also seen in üíö ff.51.1 The storytelling for green."
